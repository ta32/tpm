# Temporary Password Manager

This example uses [`next-pwa`](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa) to create a progressive web app (PWA) powered by [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/).

## About this Project

* A free and open-source password manager.

* password manager that protects all your passwords **without** a master password

* password manager where the encrypted passwords when synced online are stored using an account you control

These requirements were met by the Trezor Password Manager (TPM), but was sadly deprecated.
This project aims to re-build this Chrome extension as a PWA-WebAPP, but with better offline support 
and a more trustless way for users to install the app.
